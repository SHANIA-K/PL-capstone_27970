# 🚀 **Phase I — Problem Statement & Presentation**

## 📌 **Objective**
To identify a real-world challenge requiring a PL/SQL-based Oracle database solution that automates conflict checking, ensures ethical compliance, and prevents scheduling clashes in a law firm.

---

# 💡 **Project Summary: Law Firm Case Conflict Checker**

## 📖 **Problem Definition**
Law firms manage many cases at once. Assigning a lawyer incorrectly can lead to:

- Scheduling conflicts  
- Double booking a lawyer  
- Ethical conflicts of interest  
- Representing both client and opponent  
- Case delays and professional misconduct  

Manual validation is slow and error-prone.  
This project automates conflict detection using PL/SQL.

---

## 🌍 **Context**
The system is designed for:

- Medium-sized law firms  
- Legal administrative offices  
- Case allocation departments  

It supports safe, accurate case assignment through automated verification.

---

## 🎯 **Target Users**
- Legal administrators  
- Case managers  
- Senior lawyers  
- Law firm IT staff  

---

## 🏆 **Project Goals**
- Automatically detect scheduling conflicts  
- Prevent conflicts of interest  
- Validate lawyer & case existence  
- Ensure ethical and safe case assignment  
- Return meaningful PL/SQL messages  
- Improve firm efficiency and transparency

 # 📘 Phase II: Business Process Modeling (MIS)

### 🔍 Scope & Purpose
This phase models the *case assignment workflow* for the **LawyerFirm Case Conflict Checker System**.  
The MIS supports safe, ethical, and accurate decision-making by automating:

- Lawyer existence validation  
- Case existence validation  
- Hearing date conflict detection  
- Opponent conflict-of-interest checks  
- Controlled, transparent case assignment  

This ensures professionally compliant operations inside LawyerFirm.

### 🧠 MIS Value & Flow Summary
The workflow begins when **Admin Staff** requests to assign a lawyer to a case.  
The MIS performs automatic validation through the following steps:

1. **Validates** that the lawyer exists  
2. **Validates** that the case exists  
3. **Retrieves** the lawyer’s existing hearing dates  
4. **Checks for conflicts**, including:  
   - Hearing date clash (double booking)  
   - Opponent conflict (ethical conflict of interest)  
5. If a conflict is found → Assignment is **blocked**, error returned  
6. If no conflict is found → Assignment is **saved** into `LAWYER_CASE`

This MIS process strengthens the LawyerFirm organization through:
- Real-time conflict detection  
- Ethically safe case management  
- Reduction of manual administrative work  
- Improved accuracy and transparency  
- Faster case assignment workflow

# 🧩 Phase III: Logical Model Design

## 🎯 Objective
The logical model for the Law Firm Case Conflict Checker system was developed to support automated case assignment and prevent ethical or scheduling conflicts within a law firm. This phase transforms the business requirements from Phase I and the workflow from Phase II into a fully normalized relational database structure. The goal is to design a clean, consistent, and well-constrained logical model that allows efficient PL/SQL validation during case assignments.

| case_id     | NUMBER  | Foreign Key → CASE_FILE(case_id), part of PK   |

---

# 🔄 Relationships & Constraints

- **LAWYER → LAWYER_CASE** : One lawyer can be assigned many cases  
- **CASE_FILE → LAWYER_CASE** : Each case is assigned to one lawyer  
- **LAWYER_CASE** ensures a validated and controlled link between lawyers and cases  
- Foreign keys enforce consistency and prevent invalid assignments  

---

# 📐 Normalization (3NF Verification)

### ✔ 1NF – All data fields store atomic values  
### ✔ 2NF – Every non-key attribute fully depends on the key  
### ✔ 3NF – No transitive dependencies exist  

The schema is optimized for conflict detection efficiency.

# 📘 Phase V: Table Implementation and Data Insertion

## 🎯 Objective
To implement the physical Oracle database structure for the **LawyerFirm Case Conflict Checker System** and populate it with meaningful, testable data.  
This phase ensures data integrity, correct foreign key relationships, and realistic case–lawyer assignments that support future PL/SQL logic.

---

## 🔨 Step 1: Table Creation
The following tables were created in the schema **LAWYERFIRM_DB** using Oracle SQL Developer.

### 🧱 Table: LAWYER
A table to store lawyer information including specialties.

📄 **Screenshot:**  
`./screenshots/Phase V/lawyer_table.png`

---

### 🧱 Table: CASE_FILE
A table that stores details of legal cases, including client, opponent, and hearing date.

📄 **Screenshot:**  
`./screenshots/Phase V/casefile_table.png`

---

### 🧱 Table: LAWYER_CASE
A junction table linking lawyers to their assigned cases.

📄 **Screenshot:**  
`./screenshots/Phase V/lawyercase_table.png`

---

## 📥 Step 2: Data Insertion
Realistic sample data was inserted into each table to simulate real law firm operations.

### 🗃️ Insertion: LAWYER
Lawyers with various specialties were added.

📄 **Screenshot:**  
`./screenshots/Phase V/lawyer_inserts.png`

---

### 🗃️ Insertion: CASE_FILE
Sample court cases were inserted with client names, opponents, and hearing dates.

📄 **Screenshot:**  
`./screenshots/Phase V/casefile_inserts.png`

---

### 🗃️ Insertion: LAWYER_CASE
Initial case assignments were inserted to test conflict logic.

📄 **Screenshot:**  
`./screenshots/Phase V/lawyercase_inserts.png`

---

## 🔍 Step 3: Data Integrity Validation
JOIN queries were executed to confirm:

- ✔ All foreign key relationships are valid  
- ✔ Lawyers correctly map to their assigned cases  
- ✔ No orphan records exist  
- ✔ The system reflects realistic legal scheduling  

Validation Query Screenshot:  
`./screenshots/Phase V/data_validation.png`

---

### ✅ Validation Results Confirm:
- All **foreign keys** function correctly  
- Case-to-lawyer relationships are consistent  
- Inserted data supports future **conflict checking logic**  
- The database is ready for **Phase VI PL/SQL development**

---

# 🔧 Phase VI: PL/SQL Programming (Procedures, Functions, Cursors, Triggers, Packages)

## 🎯 Objective
To implement the core business logic of the **LawyerFirm Case Conflict Checker System** using PL/SQL.  
This phase ensures accurate validation, automated conflict detection, ethical compliance, and reliable case assignment through procedures, functions, triggers, and packages.

---

# 🧱 Database Operations

## 🔁 DML Operations
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements were used to manipulate table data during testing.

Examples:
- Inserting new lawyers  
- Modifying case hearing dates for conflict testing  
- Deleting invalid case assignments  

📄 **Screenshot:**  
`./screenshots/Phase VI/dml_operations.png`

---

## 🧩 DDL Operations
CREATE, ALTER, and DROP statements were used to build and adjust the physical schema.

Examples:
- Adding constraints to LAWYER_CASE  
- Updating CASE_FILE structure during validation tests  
- Enforcing foreign keys

# 💡 Simple Analytics Problem Statement
**“Analyze how many cases each lawyer has handled to understand workload distribution.”**

This was implemented using a window function on the `LAWYER_CASE` table:

```sql
SELECT 
    l.lawyer_id,
    l.name AS lawyer_name,
    COUNT(c.case_id) OVER (PARTITION BY l.lawyer_id) AS total_cases_assigned
FROM LAWYER_CASE c
JOIN LAWYER l ON c.lawyer_id = l.lawyer_id;
